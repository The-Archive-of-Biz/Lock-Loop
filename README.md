# Lock-Loop

This code creates a loop that locks the user's computer every 1 second and then waits for 10 seconds before repeating the process. The user is prompted to confirm if they want to continue with the loop before it begins. If the user enters "no", the program will exit. This loop will continue until the user stops it by manually closing the program or entering "no" at the prompt.
